/**
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset establishes a hybrid security model for the Rota Certa application.
 * It combines strict user-ownership for personal data with a role-based system for shared resources.
 * User profiles are private to each individual. Vehicles are public to all authenticated users for reading,
 * but can only be managed by 'admin' users. Checklists and their items are owned by the 'driver' who
 * creates them, but can also be overseen by 'admins'.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Private user profile documents.
 * - /vehicles/{vehicleId}: A top-level collection of all vehicles in the system.
 * - /checklists/{checklistId}: A top-level collection for all checklists.
 * - /maintenanceRequests/{requestId}: A top-level collection for maintenance requests.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Admin Role Check: Since authorization roles ('admin', 'driver') are stored on the /users/{userId} document,
 *   rules for administrative actions (like modifying vehicles) must perform a `get()` operation on the user's
 *   profile to verify their role. This is a deliberate trade-off for security and centralization of roles.
 * - User Listing Disabled: To protect user privacy, it is not possible to list all documents in the `/users` collection.
 * - Public Vehicle Listing: Any authenticated user can list and view vehicle details, allowing drivers to select
 *   from available vehicles. However, only admins can modify the vehicle list.
 * - Creator Ownership for Checklists: The user who creates a checklist is its owner and has full control over it.
 *   Admins have override privileges to view and manage any checklist.
 * - List Operations: `list` rules CANNOT use `get()` or `exists()`. Therefore, list queries must be secured
 *   either by allowing full reads for certain roles or by enforcing query constraints (e.g., `request.query.where`).
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The `Checklist` document contains a denormalized `userId` field. This is critical for security, as it allows rules
 * to verify ownership directly on the document without needing extra database reads, resulting in faster and more
 * secure operations.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * The data is segregated into distinct collections (/users, /vehicles, /checklists, etc). This clear separation ensures that security
 * rules are simple and that queries for public data (vehicles) do not accidentally expose private data (user profiles).
